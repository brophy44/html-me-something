          <p class="one">My parents and siblings attended a DMB concert in May 2016 at Atlanta's Ampitheatre. We arrived to talegate in the city at 5pm. Once
            parked we enjoyed sandwiches, fruit, desserts and cold drinks. <br>The concert started at 8pm. We were seated at 7pm and were lucky to have
              backstage passes where we could enjoy a closer view of the stage. Dave played his hit songs including "Grey Street", "So Much to Say", and "Crash
              Into Me" during his set.</p>

          <p class="two">My boyfriend Thomas, myself and our friends enjoyed the Journey concert at the STL Ampitheatre. We enjoyed sandwiches before the concert at the lawn
            seats with our blankets.<br>During the show, Journey played some of their classic songs including "Anyway You Want It", "Open Arms", and "Faithfully".
              They ended their show with their most popular song, "Don't Stop Believing".</p>

        <p class="three">Thomas, my dad, my sister and me traveled to Nashville to visit their music scene. Their we enjoyed various shows around the city, trying different foods and
          refreshments but Lindi Ortega's concert was the main event. She performed at the City Winery.<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/eldonthacker/eldon-thacker-show-259-hour-2-ruby-boots">Listen to the
